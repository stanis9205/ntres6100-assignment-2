## Coffee Consumption

This is my fake dataset for assignment 2 for NTRES6100.

```{r}
coffee_consumption <- matrix(c(1,1,2,2,3,6,4,1,5,4,6,2,7,0), ncol=2, byrow = TRUE)
colnames(coffee_consumption) <- c('Day_No', 'Number_of_Coffee_Cups_Consumed')
```

### Is there an upward trend of coffee consumption later in the week?

No, it appears as if there is no correlation between how late in the week it is and how much coffee I consume.  

```{r}
plot(coffee_consumption)
```
