# ntres6100-assignment-2

In this assignment, I wanted to see if there was any correlation in number of coffee cups consumed and day of the week. I made up some dummy data then plotted the average number of cups of coffee I consumed Monday-Sunday (day 1 through 7) each week. This was a good practice at starting and managing a Github repo.
